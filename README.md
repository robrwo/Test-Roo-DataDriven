# SYNOPSIS

    with qw/
      MyClass::Test::Role
      Test::Roo::DataDriven

# DESCRIPTION

This class extends [Test::Roo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Roo) for data-driven tests that are kept in
separate files.

This is useful when a test has hundreds of test cases, where it is
impractical to include all of the cases in a single test script.

This also allows different tests to share the test cases.
